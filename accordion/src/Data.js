    id:1,
    ques:"What is the difference between == and === operators",
    ans:"JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables."
},
{
    id:2,
    ques:"What are lambda or arrow functions",
    ans:"An arrow function is a shorter syntax for a function expression and does not have its own this, arguments, super, or new.target. These functions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors."
},{
    id:3,
    ques:"What is a first class function",
    ans:"In Javascript, functions are first class objects. First-class functions means when functions in that language are treated like any other variable a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable."
},
{
    id:4,
    ques:"What is a first order function",
    ans:"A first-order function is a function that doesn’t accept another function as an argument and doesn’t return a function as its return value"
},
{
    id:5,
    ques:"What is a higher order function",
    ans:"A higher-order function is a function that accepts another function as an argument or returns a function as a return value or both."
},
{
    id:6,
    ques:"What is a pure function",
    ans:"A Pure function is a function where the return value is only determined by its arguments without any side effects. i.e, If you call a function with the same arguments 'n' number of times and 'n' number of places in the application then it will always return the same value."
